# QUBEKit - *Qu*antum Mechanical *Be*spoke force field tool*kit* examples 

#### **Newcastle University UK - Cole Group**

This repository contains examples on how to use QUBEKit from both the command line as an python library.

## Demonstration day

This folder contains all of the files used during the Newcastle PGR conference live density prediction demo. We also have a notebook on how to recreate the results.

## Protein examples

QUBEKit-pro can also handel protein parametrisation and this folder shows how QUBEKit can be used to generate a ONETEP input and then parametrise a protein ready for an OpenMM simulation from the command line.
    
## ARChive fitting

This folder contains two scripts VEHICLe_QUBEKit.py and Torsion_fitting.py. They should how QUBEKit can be used to determine 
bond and angle parameters for a molecule from QCArchive using the modified seminario method and how we can 
use QUBEKit to optimise a dihedral using torsion drive data from the Archive respectively. A note book is also included 
for torsion_fitting which also covers visualising the results.
